I am fullstack software engineer with a few years of experience building applications both on front end and the back end.

On the front end, I have experience building web portals with Javascript libraries like Angular and React. 

On the back end, I built a few microservices mainly using Java (a few in groovy) in the spring framework.  
For the most part the service I built interacted with Oracle Databases. 

Long gone are the days of hosting applications in a physical or virtual server. 
As a result, my microservices are built for the cloud. This allowed me to gain CI/CD experience 
along with some Docker and Kubernetes experience as well.

What I enjoy the most, is thinking through System design in order to build efficient and scalable applications.
